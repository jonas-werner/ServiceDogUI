# ServiceDogUI
This is the repo for a UI microservice for a Service Dog management solution

## Description
The architecture consists of 5 microservices in total to allow for larger scalability and faster time-to-market 

The solution is being created by a team of presales engineers trying to learn about new technologies such as Cloud Native applications, NoSQL, Platform-as-a-Service ... by experiencing it first-hand.

The project is being done in conjunction with a US charity so that we are contributing to a good cause while we learn
